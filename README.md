# ML-Iris-Flower
Support vector machines (SVM) machine learning and data analysis/exploration of the Iris flower dataset.

SVM is utilized to predict which iris species family a given iris with specific sepal and petal dimensions belong to.

Building on top of SVM, grid search is performed in an attempt to improve the predictions.

The data set used is in-built into seaborn; but, there are various versions of it available on Kaggle as well.

Values in the dataset represent the below:
* sepal_length: cm
* sepal_width: cm
* petal_length: cm
* petal_width: cm
* species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica
